## üéØ Thesis Focus  

The research investigates **passive vibration isolation platforms** for robotic reworking operations in the automotive sector.  
- Development of a **conventional folded-beam isolator** and a **novel Stewart-based folded-beam isolator**.  
- Structural modeling, modal analysis, and experimental validation using a **random orbital sanding tool** as the application case.  
- Collaboration with IIT HHCM Lab for design, fabrication, and testing.
